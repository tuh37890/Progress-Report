Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created the zoo animal drawings/aesthetics and colored in some of the animals using turtles

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't drawn all of the zoo animals yet and colored them in. I also need to allow the user to select which drawing they want to have and to try to have music in the simulation. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I am having problems with figuring out the code for the user being able to pick the code they want. I think that I will need a bunch of if else statements while loops and some 4 loops. I am excited to get the project done other than that and I love using turtles.
